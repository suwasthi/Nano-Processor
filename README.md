# 4-bit Nanoprocessor

A simple 4-bit nanoprocessor designed using VHDL and implemented on the BASYS 3 FPGA board. Developed as part of the CS1050 (Computer Organization and Digital Design) course at the University of Moratuwa.

## üîß Features

- 4-bit ALU supporting **ADD** and **NEG** using 2's complement arithmetic
- Custom 12-bit instruction set (MOVI, ADD, NEG, JZR)
- 3-bit Program Counter with reset functionality
- 8-register 4-bit Register Bank (R0‚ÄìR7), R0 hardcoded to zero
- Instruction Decoder to activate appropriate processor modules
- ROM-based Program Memory (hard-coded instructions)
- Multiplexers and buses to route data/control signals
- Clock slowed to 2‚Äì3 seconds for visibility of instruction execution
- Output on LEDs and 7-segment display (R7 used for result display)

## üõ† Tools & Technologies

- VHDL (RTL design)
- Vivado Design Suite
- BASYS 3 FPGA Board
- Timing simulation (testbenches)
- 7-Segment Display & LEDs for output

##  Instruction Set

| Instruction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `MOVI R, d` | Move immediate value `d` to register `R` |
| `ADD Ra, Rb` | Add contents of `Ra` and `Rb`, store in `Ra` |
| `NEG R` | Negate value in register `R` |
| `JZR R, d` | Jump to address `d` if register `R` is zero |

##  Sample Program

```asm
MOVI R1, 10   ; R1 ‚Üê 10  
MOVI R2, 1    ; R2 ‚Üê 1  
NEG R2        ; R2 ‚Üê -1  
ADD R1, R2    ; R1 ‚Üê R1 + R2  
JZR R1, 7     ; If R1 == 0, jump to instruction at address 7
